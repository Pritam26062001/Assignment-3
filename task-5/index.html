<!-- The z-index property in CSS controls the stacking order of elements that overlap each other. Elements with a higher z-index are displayed in front of those with a lower z-index. However, the z-index property only works on positioned elements (those with a position value other than static). -->

<!-- 
1.HTML Structure:

The HTML consists of three div elements with classes box red, box blue, and box green.
2.CSS Styling:

The .box class applies common styles to all boxes: setting their width, height, and positioning them absolutely.
Each color class (.red, .blue, .green) sets the background color, specific z-index values, and positions.
3.z-index Property:

.red box has a z-index of 1.
.blue box has a z-index of 3.
.green box has a z-index of 2.

Given these z-index values:

The .blue box (z-index: 3) will be on top of both the .red and .green boxes.
The .green box (z-index: 2) will be below the .blue box but above the .red box.
The .red box (z-index: 1) will be at the bottom. -->
